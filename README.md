# Machine Learning Project on Covid-19 Cases Prediction

#### I will start the task of Covid-19 cases prediction with Python for the next 30 days by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset

## Data Preparation
#### Now the next step is data preparation, I will simply prepare new data by combining the above datasets and then we will visualize a geographical plot of the data to see what we are going to work with

## Data Visualization
#### Now here I will prepare three visualizations. One will be a geographical visualization to visualize the worldwide spread of Covid-19. Then the next visualization will be to have a look at the daily cases of Covid-19 in the world. Then the last visualization will be to have a look at the daily death cases of Covid-19 in the world.

## Covid-19 Cases Prediction with Python for Next 30 Days
#### Now, I will use the Facebook prophet model for the task of Covid-19 cases prediction with Python for the next 30 days. Facebook prophet model uses time series method for forecasting.
